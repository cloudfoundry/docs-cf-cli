title: Getting started with the cf CLI
owner: CLI
---


The cf CLI is the official command line client for Cloud Foundry. You can use the cf CLI to manage apps, service instances, orgs, spaces, and users in your environment.


## <a id='prerequisite'></a> Prerequisite

To follow the procedures in this topic, you must download and install the latest version of the cf CLI v7 or v8. For more information, see [Installing the Cloud Foundry command line interface](install-go-cli.html).


## <a id='login'></a> Log in with the CLI

The `cf login` command uses the syntax described below to specify a target API endpoint, login credentials, an org, and a space.

The cf CLI prompts for credentials as needed. If you are a member of multiple orgs or spaces, `cf login` prompts you to specify the org or space to which you
want to log in. Otherwise, it targets your org and space automatically.

To log in to the cf CLI:

1. In a terminal window, run:

    ```
    cf login -a API-URL -u USERNAME -p PASSWORD -o ORG -s SPACE
    ```

    Where:
    <ul>
    <li><code>API-URL</code> is your API endpoint, <%= vars.api_endpoint %>.</li>
    <li><code>USERNAME</code> is your username.</li>
    <li><code>PASSWORD</code> is your password. <%= vars.company_name %> discourages using the <code>-p</code> option, because it records your password in your shell history.</li>
    <li><code>ORG</code> is the org where you want to deploy your apps.</li>
    <li><code>SPACE</code> is the space in the org where you want to deploy your apps.</li>
    </ul>

When you successfully log in, you see output similar to the following example:

<pre class="terminal">
API endpoint: https://api.example.com

Password>
Authenticating...
OK

Targeted org example-org

Targeted space development


API endpoint:   https://api.example.com
User:           username<span>@</span>example.com
Org:            example-org
Space:          development
</pre>

Alternatively, you can write a script to log in and set your target using the non-interactive [cf api](http://cli.cloudfoundry.org/en-US/cf/api.html), [cf auth](http://cli.cloudfoundry.org/en-US/cf/auth.html), and [cf target](http://cli.cloudfoundry.org/en-US/cf/target.html) commands. See [UAAC](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-uaac/blob/master/README.md) for setting up `client_id` and `client_secret`.

## <a id='login'></a> Log in with the API

You can write a script to log in to the cf CLI. This allows you to avoid manually logging in to the cf CLI each time you use it.

To write a script to log in:

1. In a terminal window, target your API by running:

    ```
    cf api API-URL
    ```
    Where `API-URL` is your API endpoint, <%= vars.api_endpoint %>.
    <br>
    <br>
    For more information about the `cf api` command, see the [Cloud Foundry CLI Reference Guide](http://cli.cloudfoundry.org/en-US/cf/api.html).

1. Authenticate by running:

    ```
    cf auth USERNAME PASSWORD
    ```
    Where:
    <ul>
      <li><code>USERNAME</code> is your username.</li>
      <li><code>PASSWORD</code> is your password. <%= vars.company_name %> discourages using the <code>-p</code> option, because it records your password in your shell history.</li>
    </ul>

    For more information about the `cf auth` command, see the [Cloud Foundry CLI Reference Guide](http://cli.cloudfoundry.org/en-US/cf/auth.html).

1. Target your org or space by running:

    ```
    cf target -o ORG -s SPACE
    ```
    Where:
    <ul>
      <li><code>ORG</code> is the org you want to target.</li>
      <li><code>SPACE</code> is the space you want to target.</li>
    </ul>

    For more information about the `cf target` command, see the [Cloud Foundry CLI Reference Guide](http://cli.cloudfoundry.org/en-US/cf/target.html).

After you log in, the cf CLI saves a `config.json` file that contains your API endpoint, org, space values, and access token. If you change these settings,
the `config.json` file is updated accordingly.

By default, `config.json` is located in the `~/.cf` directory. You can relocate the `config.json` file using the `CF_HOME` environment variable.


## <a id='i18n'></a> Localize the cf CLI

The cf CLI translates terminal output into the language that you select. The default language is `en-US`.

The cf CLI supports these languages:

*  Chinese (simplified): `zh-Hans`
*  Chinese (traditional): `zh-Hant`
*  English: `en-US`
*  French: `fr-FR`
*  German: `de-DE`
*  Italian: `it-IT`
*  Japanese: `ja-JP`
*  Korean: `ko-KR`
*  Portuguese (Brazil): `pt-BR`
*  Spanish: `es-ES`

For more information about the `cf config --locale` command, see the [Cloud Foundry CLI Reference Guide](http://cli.cloudfoundry.org/en-US/cf/config.html).

<p> Localizing the cf CLI affects only messages that the cf CLI generates.</p>

To set the language of the cf CLI:

1. In a terminal window, log in to the cf CLI:

    ```
    cf login
    ```

1. Run:

    ```
    cf config --locale LANGUAGE
    ```
    Where `LANGUAGE` is code of the language you want to set. Valid values are `zh-Hans`, `zh-Hant`, `en-US`, `fr-FR`, `de-DE`, `it-IT`, `ja-JP`, `ko-KR`,
    `pt-BR`, and `es-ES`.

1. Confirm the language change by running:

    ```
    cf help
    ```
    The above command returns output similar to the example below:
    <pre class="terminal">
    NOME:
       cf - Uma ferramenta de linha de comando para interagir com Cloud Foundry

    USO:
       cf [opções globais] comando [argumentos...] [opções de comando]

    VERSÃO:
       6.14.1
       ...
    </pre>


## <a id='user-roles'></a> Manage users and roles

The cf CLI includes commands that list users and assign roles in orgs and spaces.

### <a id='listing-users'></a> List users

To list all users in an org or a space:

1. In a terminal window, log in to the cf CLI:

    ```
    cf login
    ```

1. Run one of these commands:
    * To list org users, run:

        ```
        cf org-users ORG
        ```
        Where `ORG` is the name of the org for which you want to see the list of users.
        <br>
        <br>
        The above command returns output similar to the example below:
        <pre class="terminal">
        Getting users in org example-org as username<span>@</span>example.com...

        ORG MANAGER
          username<span>@</span>example.com

        BILLING MANAGER
          huey<span>@</span>example.com
          dewey<span>@</span>example.com

        ORG AUDITOR
          louie<span>@</span>example.com
        </pre>
    * To list space users, run:

        ```
        cf space-users ORG SPACE
        ```
        Where:
        <ul>
          <li><code>ORG</code> is the name of the org that contains the space for which you want to see the list of users.</li>
          <li><code>SPACE</code> is the name of the space for which you want to see the list of users.</li>
        </ul>

        The above command returns output similar to the example below:
        <pre class="terminal">
        Getting users in org example-org / space example-space as username<span>@</span>example.com...

        SPACE MANAGER
          username<span>@</span>example.com

        SPACE DEVELOPER
          huey<span>@</span>example.com
          dewey<span>@</span>example.com

        SPACE AUDITOR
          louie<span>@</span>example.com
        </pre>

For more information about the `cf org-users` command, see the [Cloud Foundry CLI Reference Guide](http://cli.cloudfoundry.org/en-US/cf/org-users.html). For
more information about the `cf space-users` command, see the [Cloud Foundry CLI Reference Guide](http://cli.cloudfoundry.org/en-US/cf/space-users.html).

### <a id='managing-roles'></a> Manage roles

You use the commands listed below to manage roles in the cf CLI. These commands require admin permissions and take `username`, `org` or `space`, and `role` as
arguments:

* `cf set-org-role`<br>For more information, see the [Cloud Foundry CLI Reference Guide](http://cli.cloudfoundry.org/en-US/cf/set-org-role.html).

* `cf unset-org-role`<br>For more information, see the [Cloud Foundry CLI Reference Guide](http://cli.cloudfoundry.org/en-US/cf/unset-org-role.html).

* `cf set-space-role`<br>For more information, see the [Cloud Foundry CLI Reference Guide](http://cli.cloudfoundry.org/en-US/cf/set-space-role.html).

* `cf unset-space-role`<br>For more information, see the [Cloud Foundry CLI Reference Guide](http://cli.cloudfoundry.org/en-US/cf/unset-space-role.html).

The available roles are:

* `OrgManager`
* `BillingManager`
* `OrgAuditor`
* `SpaceManager`
* `SpaceDeveloper`
* `SpaceAuditor`

For more information about user roles, see [Orgs, Spaces, Roles, and Permissions](../concepts/roles.html).

The following example shows the terminal output for `cf set-org-role huey@example.com example-org OrgManager`, which assigns the Org Manager role to
`huey@example.com` within the `example-org` org:

<pre class="terminal">
Assigning role OrgManager to user huey<span>@</span>example.com in org example-org as username<span>@</span>example.com...
OK
</pre>

<p class="note important">
<span class="note__title"><strong>Important</strong></span>
If you are not an admin, you see this message when you try to run these commands: <code>error code: 10003, message: You
are not authorized to perform the requested action</code></p>

### <a id='multi-origin'></a> Manage roles for users with identical usernames in multiple origins

If a username corresponds to multiple accounts from different user stores, such as both the internal UAA store and an external SAML or LDAP store, running
either `cf set-org-role` or `cf unset-org-role` returns an error similar to the following example:

<pre class="terminal">The user exists in multiple origins. Specify an origin for the requested user from: ‘uaa’, ‘other’</pre>

To resolve this ambiguity, you can construct a `curl` command that uses the API to perform the desired role management function. For an example, see the
[Cloud Foundry API documentation](https://v3-apidocs.cloudfoundry.org/version/3.169.0/index.html#create-a-role).


## <a id='push'></a> Push an app

These sections describe how to use the `cf push` command to push a new app or sync changes to an existing app.

For more information about the `cf push` command, see the [Cloud Foundry CLI Reference Guide](http://cli.cloudfoundry.org/en-US/cf/push.html).

### <a id='push-procedure'></a> Push a new app or push changes to an app

To push an app:

1. In a terminal window, log in to the cf CLI by running:

    ```
    cf login
    ```

1. Go to the directory of the app.

1. Push a new app or push changes to an app by running:

    ```
    cf push APP-NAME
    ```
    Where `APP-NAME` is the name of the app.

### <a id='push-path'></a> Push an app using a manifest

You can provide a path to a manifest file when you push an app. The manifest file includes information such as the name of the app, disk limit, and number
of instances. You can use a manifest file rather than adding flags to the `cf push` command.

`cf push` locates the `manifest.yml` file in the current working directory by default. Alternatively, you can provide a path to the manifest with the `-f`
flag.

For more information about the `-f` flag, see the [Cloud Foundry CLI Reference Guide](http://cli.cloudfoundry.org/en-US/cf/push.html).

<p class="note">
<span class="note__title"><strong>Note</strong></span>
When you provide an app name at the command line, the <code>cf push</code> command uses that app
name regardless of whether there is a different app name in the manifest. If the manifest configures multiple apps, you can push a
single app by providing thenname at the command line; the cf CLI does not push the others. Use these behaviors for testing.</p>

### <a id='push-buildpack'></a> Push an app with a buildpack

You can specify a buildpack when you push an app with the `-b` flag. If you use the `-b` flag to specify a buildpack, the app remains permanently linked to
that buildpack. To use the app with a different buildpack, you must delete the app and then push it again.

For more information about available buildpacks, see the [Cloud Foundry documentation](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/buildpacks/).

The following example shows the terminal output for `cf push awesome-app -b ruby_buildpack`, which pushes an app called `awesome-app` to the URL
`http://awesome-app.example.com` and specifies the Ruby buildpack with the `-b` flag:

<pre class="terminal">
Pushing app awesome-app to org example-org / space development as username@example.com...

...

Waiting for app awesome-app to start...

To avoid security exposure, verify that you migrate your apps and custom
buildpacks to use the <code>cflinuxfs4</code> stack based on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (Jammy Jellyfish). The <code>cflinuxfs3</code> stack is
based on Ubuntu 18.04 (Bionic Beaver), which reaches end of standard support in April 2023.</p>

### <a id='new-route'></a> Map a route to an app

You can provide a hostname for your app when you push the app. If you do not provide a hostname, the `cf push` command routes your app to a URL of the form `APP-NAME.DOMAIN`, where `APP-NAME` is the name of your app and `DOMAIN` is your default domain. The route definition is included in the `manifest.yml` file.

For information about mapping a route to your app, see [Routes and domains](../devguide/deploy-apps/routes-domains.html).

To map a route to the app:

1. In a terminal window, log in to the cf CLI by running:

    ```
    cf login
    ```

1. Push and map a route by running:

    ```
    cf push -f manifest.yml --var host=APP-HOSTNAME
    ```

    Where:
    <ul>
      <li><code>APP-NAME</code> is the name of the app.</li>
      <li><code>APP-DOMAIN</code> is the domain of the app.</li>
      <li><code>APP-HOSTNAME</code> is the hostname of the app.</li>
    </ul>

## <a id='user-provided'></a> Manage user-provided service instances

These sections describe how to create or update a service instance.

### <a id='user-cups'></a> Create a service instance

To create a new service instance, use the `cf create-user-provided-service` or `cf cups` commands. For more information about the
`cf create-user-provided-service` and `cf cups` commands, see the [Cloud Foundry CLI Reference
Guide](http://cli.cloudfoundry.org/en-US/cf/create-user-provided-service.html).

To create or update a user-provided service instance, you must supply basic parameters. For example, a database service might require a username, password,
host, port, and database name.

You can provide these parameters in the following ways:

* Interactively. For more information, see [Supply Parameters Interactively](#interactive) below.

* Non-interactively. For more information, see [Supply Parameters Non-Interactively](#non-interactive) below.

* With third-party log management software as described in RFC 6587. For more information, see [Supply Parameters Through a Third Party](#third-party) below
and [RFC 6587](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6587).

<p> When used with third-party logging, data is sent formatted according to RFC 5424. For more information, see
      <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5424">RFC 5424</a>.</p>

#### <a id='interactive'></a> Supply parameters interactively

To create a new service while supplying parameters interactively:

1. In a terminal window, log in to the cf CLI by running:

    ```
    cf login
    ```

1. List parameters in a comma-separated list after the `-p` flag. Run:

    ```
    cf cups SERVICE -p "PARAMETER, SECOND-PARAMETER, THIRD-PARAMETER"
    ```

    Where:
    <ul>
      <li><code>SERVICE</code> is the name of the service you want to create.</li>
      <li><code>PARAMETER</code>, <code>SECOND-PARAMETER</code>, and <code>THIRD-PARAMETER</code> are parameters such as username, password, host, port, and database name.</li>
    </ul>


#### <a id='non-interactive'></a> Supply parameters non-interactively

To create a new service while supplying parameters non-interactively:

1. In a terminal window, log in to the cf CLI by running:

    ```
    cf login
    ```

1. Pass parameters and their values in as a JSON hash, bound by single quotes, after the `-p` tag. Run:

    ```
    cf cups SERVICE -p '{"host":"HOSTNAME", "port":"PORT"}'
    ```

    Where:
    <ul>
      <li><code>SERVICE</code> is the name of the service you want to create.</li>
      <li><code>HOSTNAME</code> and <code>PORT</code> are service parameters.</li>
    </ul>

#### <a id='third-party'></a> Supply parameters through a third party

For specific log service instructions, see [Streaming app logs to third-party services](../devguide/services/log-management-thirdparty-svc.html).

To create a service instance that sends data to a third party:

1. Log in to the cf CLI:

    ```
    cf login
    ```
1. Create a service instance that sends data to a third party by running:

    ```
    cf cups SERVICE -l THIRD-PARTY-DESTINATION-URL
    ```

    Where:
    <ul>
      <li><code>SERVICE</code> is the name of the service you want to create.</li>
      <li><code>THIRD-PARTY-DESTINATION-URL</code> is the external URL of the third-party service.</li>
    </ul>

### <a id='bind-unbind'></a> Bind and unbind service instances

After you create a user-provided service instance, you can:

* Bind the service to an app with `cf bind-service`. For more information, see the [Cloud Foundry CLI Reference
Guide](http://cli.cloudfoundry.org/en-US/cf/bind-service.html).

* Unbind the service with `cf unbind-service`. For more information, see the [Cloud Foundry CLI Reference
Guide](http://cli.cloudfoundry.org/en-US/cf/unbind-service.html).

* Rename the service with `cf rename-service`. For more information, see the [Cloud Foundry CLI Reference
Guide](http://cli.cloudfoundry.org/en-US/cf/rename-service.html).

* Delete the service with `cf delete-service`. For more information, see the [Cloud Foundry CLI Reference
Guide](http://cli.cloudfoundry.org/en-US/cf/delete-service.html).

### <a id='user-uups'></a> Update a service instance

To update one or more of the parameters for an existing user-provided service instance, use `cf update-user-provided-service` or `cf uups`.

For more information about the `cf update-user-provided-service` and `cf uups` commands, see the [Cloud Foundry CLI Reference
Guide](http://cli.cloudfoundry.org/en-US/cf/update-user-provided-service.html).

<p> The <code>cf uups</code> command does not update any parameter values that you do not supply.</p>


## <a id='return-codes'></a> Retrieve cf CLI return codes

The cf CLI uses exit codes, which help with scripting and confirming that a command has run successfully.

To view a cf CLI exit code:

1. In a terminal window, log in to the cf CLI by running:

    ```
    cf login
    ```

1. To check that the login was successful, run one of these commands, depending on your OS:
    * For Mac OS, run:

        ```
        echo $?
        ```
    * For Windows, run:

        ```
        echo %ERRORLEVEL%
        ```

If the command succeeds, the exit code is `0`.


## <a id='help'></a> View CLI help output

The `cf help` command lists the cf CLI commands and a brief description of each. For more information, see the [Cloud Foundry CLI Reference
Guide](http://cli.cloudfoundry.org/en-US/cf/help.html).

To list detailed help for any cf CLI command, add the `-h` flag to the command.

The example below shows detailed help output for the `cf delete` command:

<pre class="terminal">
NAME:
   delete - Delete an app

USAGE:
   cf delete APP_NAME [-f -r]

ALIAS:
   d

OPTIONS:
   -f       Force deletion without confirmation
   -r       Delete any mapped routes (only deletes routes mapped to a single app)
</pre>
