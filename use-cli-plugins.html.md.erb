title: Using a cf CLI plug-in
owner: CLI
---


The Cloud Foundry CLI (cf CLI) includes plug-in capability. The plug-in allows you to add custom commands to the cf CLI.

You can install and use the plug-in that Cloud Foundry developers and third-party developers create. For a current list of community-supported plug-ins, see the [Cloud Foundry Community CLI Plug-in page](https://plugins.cloudfoundry.org). For information about submitting your own plug-in, see the [Cloud Foundry CLI Plugin Repository (CLIPR)](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/cli-plugin-repo) repository on GitHub.

<p class='note warning'><strong>Caution:</strong> Plug-ins are not vetted, including for security or function. Use plug-ins at your own risk.</p>

The cf CLI identifies a plugin by its binary filename, its developer-defined plugin name, and the commands that the plugin provides. You use the binary filename only to install a plugin. You use the plugin name or a command for any other action.

The cf CLI uses case-sensitive commands, but plug-in management commands accept plug-in and repository names irrespective of their casing.</p>


## <a id="plugin-directory"></a> Changing the plug-in directory

By default, the cf CLI stores plugins on your workstation in `$CF_HOME/.cf/plugins`, which defaults to `$HOME/.cf/plugins`.

To change the root directory of this path from `$CF_HOME`, you must set the `CF_PLUGIN_HOME` environment variable.

The cf CLI appends `.cf/plugins` to the `CF_PLUGIN_HOME` path that you specify and stores plug ins in that location. For example, if you set `CF_PLUGIN_HOME` to `/my-folder`, cf CLI stores plug-ins in `/my-folder/.cf/plugins`.


## <a id="plugin-install"></a> Installing a plug-in

To install a plugin:

1. Download a binary or the source code for a plugin from a trusted provider. The cf CLI requires a binary file compiled from source code written in Go. If you download source code, you must compile the code to create a binary.

1. Run:

    ```
    cf install-plugin BINARY-FILENAME
    ```
    Where `BINARY-FILENAME` is the path to and name of your binary file.

Additional notes:

* You cannot install a plug in that has the same name or that uses the same command as an existing plugin. If you try this, you are prompted to uninstall the existing plugin.

* The cf CLI prohibits you from implementing any plugin that uses a native cf CLI command name or alias. For example, if you attempt to install a third-party plugin that includes the `cf push` command, the cf CLI halts the installation.

For more information, see [install-plugin](http://cli.cloudfoundry.org/en-US/cf/install-plugin.html) in the _Cloud Foundry CLI Reference Guide_.

## <a id="plugin-run-cmd"></a> Managing plug-ins and running plug-in commands

Use the contents of the `cf help` **CLI plugin management** and **Commands offered by installed plugins** sections to manage plugins and run plugin commands.

To manage plugins and run plugin commands:

1. List all installed plugins and all commands that the plugins provide by running:

    ```
    cf plugins
    ```

1. Execute a plugin command by running:

    ```
    cf PLUGIN-COMMAND
    ```
    Where `PLUGIN-COMMAND` is the plugin command you want to execute.


## <a id="plugins-outdated"></a> Checking for plug-in updates

To check all registered plugin repositories for newer versions of currently installed plugins:

1. Run:

    ```
    cf plugins --outdated
    ```

1. See the output of the above command, as in the example below:
    <pre class="terminal">
    $ cf plugins --outdated
    Searching CF-Community, company-repo for newer versions of installed plugins...
    plugin          version   latest version
    coffeemaker     1.1.2     1.2.0
    Use 'cf install-plugin' to update a plugin to the latest version.
    </pre>

For more information about the `cf plugins` command, see [cf plugins](http://cli.cloudfoundry.org/en-US/cf/plugins.html) in the _Cloud Foundry CLI Reference Guide_.


## <a id="plugin-uninstall"></a> Uninstalling a plug-in

To uninstall a plugin:

1. View the names of all installed plugins by running:

    ```
    cf plugins
    ```

1. Run:

    ```
    cf uninstall-plugin PLUGIN-NAME
    ```
    Where `PLUGIN-NAME` is the name of the plug-in you want to uninstall.
    <p class='note'><strong>Note:</strong> You must use the name of the plug-in to uninstall it, not the binary filename.</p>

For more information, see [uninstall-plugin](http://cli.cloudfoundry.org/en-US/cf/uninstall-plugin.html) in the _Cloud Foundry CLI Reference Guide_.

## <a id="adding-plugin-repo"></a> Adding a plug-in repository

To add a plugin repository:

1. Run:

    ```
    cf add-plugin-repo REPOSITORY-NAME-URL
    ```
    Where `REPOSITORY-NAME-URL` is the URL of the plugin repository you want to add.

For more information, see [add-plugin-repo](http://cli.cloudfoundry.org/en-US/cf/add-plugin-repo.html) in the _Cloud Foundry CLI Reference Guide_.


## <a id="listing-plugin-repo"></a> Viewing available plug-in repositories

To view your available plugin repositories:

1. Run:

    ```
    cf list-plugin-repos
    ```

For more information, see [list-plugin-repos](http://cli.cloudfoundry.org/en-US/cf/list-plugin-repos.html) in the _Cloud Foundry CLI Reference Guide_.


## <a id="listing-plugin-repo"></a> Listing all plug-ins by repository

To show all plugins from all available repositories:

1. Run:

    ```
    cf repo-plugins
    ```

For more information, see [repo-plugins](http://cli.cloudfoundry.org/en-US/cf/repo-plugins.html) in the _Cloud Foundry CLI Reference Guide_.


## <a id="troubleshoot"></a> Troubleshooting

The cf CLI provides the error messages described below to help you troubleshoot installation and usage issues. Third-party plugins can provide their own error messages.

### <a id='permission-denied'></a> Permission denied

If you receive a `permission denied` error message, you lack required permissions to the plugin. You must have `read` and `execute` permissions to the plugin binary file.

### <a id='plugin-command-collision'></a> Plug-in command collision

Plugin names and commands must be unique. The CLI displays an error message if you attempt to install a plugin with a non-unique name or command.

If the plugin has the same name or command as a currently installed plugin, you must first uninstall the existing plugin to install the new plugin.

If the plugin has a command with the same name as a native cf CLI command or alias, you cannot install the plugin.
