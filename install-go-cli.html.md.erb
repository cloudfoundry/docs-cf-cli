The cf CLI is the official command line client for Cloud Foundry.

The following procedures describe how to install the cf CLI on your operating system. You can install the cf CLI with a package manager, an installer, or a compressed binary.

For more information about how to use the cf CLI, see [Getting Started with cf CLI](getting-started.html).

To learn when cf CLI updates are released and to download a new binary or installer, see [Releases](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli/releases) in the Cloud Foundry CLI repository on GitHub.

There are currently two major versions of the cf CLI: v7 and v8. See [the README](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli/blob/master/README.md) to decide which version to use.
