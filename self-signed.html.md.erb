title: Using the cf CLI with a self-signed certificate
owner: CLI

This topic describes how developers use the Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface (cf CLI)
to communicate securely with a Cloud Foundry deployment that uses a self-signed certificate.

You can use the cf CLI to communicate securely with a Cloud Foundry deployment without
specifying `--skip-ssl-validation` under the following conditions:

* The deployment uses a self-signed certificate.

* The deployment uses a certificate that is signed by a self-signed certificate authority (CA), or by an intermediate certificate that is also signed by a self-signed CA.

<%= vars.self_signed %>


## <a id="install-local"></a> Installing the certificate on physical machines

The certificates you must insert into your local trust store vary depending on the configuration of your deployment:

* If the deployment uses a self-signed certificate, you must insert the self-signed certificate into your local trust store.

* If the deployment uses a certificate signed by a self-signed CA, or a certificate signed by a certificate that is signed by a self-signed CA, you must insert the self-signed certificate and any intermediate certificates into your local trust store.

### <a id="macosx"></a> Installing the Certificate on macOS X

To place the certificate file `server.crt` into your local trust store for macOS X:

1. Run:

    ```
    sudo security add-trusted-cert -d -r trustRoot -k /Library/Keychains/System.keychain server.crt
    ```

### <a id="linux"></a> Installing the certificate on Linux

To place the certificate file `server.crt` into your trust store for Linux:

1. Run one of the following commands, depending on your Linux distribution:
    * For Debian, Ubuntu, or Gentoo, run:

        ```
        cat server.crt >> /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt
        ```
    * For Fedora or RHEL, run:

        ```
        cat server.crt >> /etc/pki/tls/certs/ca-bundle.crt
        ```

The previous examples set the certificate permanently on your machine across all users and require `sudo` permissions. To set the certificate only in your current terminal or script, run one of these commands:

* Option 1:

    ```console
    export SSL_CERT_FILE=PATH-TO-SERVER.crt
    ```
    Where `PATH-TO-SERVER.crt` is the filepath of the `server.crt` certificate file.

* Option 2:

    ```console
    export SSL_CERT_DIR=PATH-TO-SERVER-DIRECTORY
    ```
    Where `PATH-TO-SERVER-DIRECTORY` is the directory of the `server.crt` certificate file.

### <a id="windows"></a> Installing the certificate on Windows

To place the certificate file `server.crt` into your local trust store for Windows:

1. Right-click the certificate file.

1. Click **Install Certificate**.

1. Choose to install the certificate as the **Current User** or **Local Machine**.

1. From the certification store list, select **Trusted Root Certification Authorities**.
