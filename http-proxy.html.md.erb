title: Using the cf CLI with a proxy server
owner: CLI
---


If you have an HTTP or SOCKS5 proxy server on your network between a host running the Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface (cf CLI) and your API endpoint, you must
set the `https_proxy` variable with the hostname or IP address of the proxy server. The `https_proxy` environment variable holds the hostname or IP address of the
proxy server.

The `https_proxy` variable is a standard environment variable. As with any environment variable, the specific steps used to set it depends on your operating
system.


## <a id="format"></a> Format of https_proxy

The `https_proxy` variable is set with hostname or IP address of the proxy server in URL format, as shown in the following example:

```
https_proxy=http://proxy.example.com
```

If the proxy server requires a username and password, you must include the credentials, as shown in the following example:

```
https_proxy=http://username:password@proxy.example.com
```

If the proxy server uses a port other than 80, you must include the port number, as shown in the following example:

```
https_proxy=http://username:password@proxy.example.com:8080
```

If the proxy server is a SOCKS5 proxy, you must specify the SOCKS5 protocol in the URL, as shown in the following example:

```
https_proxy=socks5://socks_proxy.example.com
```

The <code>cf ssh</code> command for cf CLI v7 does not work through a SOCKS5 proxy.


## <a id="mac-linux"></a> Set https_proxy in macOS or Linux

To set the `https_proxy` environment variable in macOS or Linux:

1. Use the command specific to your shell. For example, in bash, use the `export` command, as shown in the following example:

    ```
    export https_proxy=http://my.proxyserver.com:8080
    ```

1. To make this change persistent, add the command to the appropriate profile file for the shell. For example, in bash, add a
line similar to the following example to your `.bash_profile` or `.bashrc` file:

    ```
    https_proxy=http://username:password@hostname:port
    export $https_proxy
    ```
